# StockTrend Forecaster

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting the movement (up/down) of S&P 500 stocks using a Random Forest classifier. The goal is to reduce trade frequency while maximizing profits by predicting whether a stock will go up or down, without forecasting its exact price.

## Features

- **Stock Movement Prediction**: Predicts whether a stockâ€™s price will go **up** or **down** based on historical data.
- **Low Trade Frequency**: Designed to minimize unnecessary trades while aiming to increase overall profitability.
- **Random Forest**: Utilizes the Random Forest algorithm to classify stock movements with high accuracy.
